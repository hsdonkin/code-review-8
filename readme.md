# _Word Definer_

#### By _**Hugh Donkin**_

## Description

_Make an application that contains a Word class. The homepage of the app should list all words. When a word is clicked, it should lead to a page with the word's definitions. User should be able to add a word, and when viewing a word, be able to add, update or delete one or more definitions._

## Known Bugs
